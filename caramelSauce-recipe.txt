Ingredients

    ¼ cup (60 ml) water
    1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
    ⅔ cup (160 ml) heavy whipping cream
    3 tablespoons (45 grams) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoon size pieces
    1 teaspoon vanilla
    1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)

Instructions

    1. In a heavy bottomed saucepan, heat the water and sugar over medium heat. Make sure to use a saucepan that's
       a little bigger than what you think you will need. Stir constantly until the sugar has dissolved and 
       the mixture starts to bubble just  a little.
    2. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, stop stirring completely. Let the mixture continue boiling until
       it turns an amber color, this could take anywhere from 4-12 minutes.
    3. Remove from the heat and slowly whisk in the heavy cream. The mixture will bubble up quite a bit, so make sure to
       do this very carefully. Then, mix in the butter, vanilla, and salt one at a time.
    4.Pour the caramel sauce into a dish and allow to cool completely, then cover tightly and store in the refrigerator. 
      The caramel sauce will thicken up some once it's cooled and      refrigerated.
